# App Shell Refactor

## Goal

Reduce the size and coupling of `src/App.tsx` and `src/styles.css` without changing Jira, local-note, recurring-entry, or release behavior.

## Current Decision

Continue with narrow hooks from `App.tsx` only when their behavior can be covered independently. Jira sync, Jira worklog writes, Bitbucket review logging, local-note actions, and recurring actions now have hook-level coverage; the remaining large-file work is the styles split.

## Phases

1. Done: extract pure app helpers into `src/app/appHelpers.ts`.
2. Done: add unit coverage for URL normalization, ticket sorting, personal-note merging/grouping, and demo update metadata.
3. Done: extract `useSnackbars` from `App.tsx` with hook-level coverage.
4. Done: extract `useThemeMode` from `App.tsx` with storage, system preference, and demo-mode coverage.
5. Done: extract `useLiveDate` from `App.tsx` with fake-timer coverage for ticking, demo freeze, and cleanup.
6. Done: extract `useReleaseUpdates` from `App.tsx` with demo, cache, native success/error, and open-action coverage.
7. Done: extract `useTickets` from `App.tsx` with loading, search, favorite, and derived-list coverage.
8. Done: extract read-only issue metadata from `App.tsx` with visible-week scoping, issue maps, today worklog, and touched-ticket coverage.
9. Done: extract `useJiraSync` from `App.tsx` with queueing, persistence, demo, success, and error coverage.
10. Done: extract `useJiraWorklogs` from `App.tsx` with add/update/delete, optimistic merge, ticket refresh, edit modal state, and demo/error coverage.
11. Done: extract `useBitbucketReviewLogging` from `App.tsx` with demo, Jira target, review-bucket, persistence, no-target, and partial-failure coverage.
12. Done: extract local-note action/import state into `usePersonalNotes` with storage, demo, move-between-weeks, import, and error coverage.
13. Done: extract recurring modal/action state into `useRecurringActions` with event definition, confirm, skip, delete, candidate, demo, storage, and error coverage.
14. Next: split `src/styles.css` mechanically into imported files after UI behavior is protected.
